To update inkscape.pot run
  intltool-update --pot && mv untitled.pot inkscape.pot
from the /po directory

This is also done by executing the cmake target 'inkscape_pot', e.g. 'make inkscape_pot' (delete inkscape.pot first)



WARNING:
If new source files are added this is not sufficient!

In this case please run
  ./generate_POTFILES.sh
This will update POTFILES.in with the list of current source files (to exclude a file add it to POTFILES.skip)

Afterwards update the inkscape.pot file as described above



TODO:
- automate these steps within CMake
- consider dropping intltool-update and use xgettext with proper options
  (it should be able to handle most of our source files nowadays)
- clean up this directory, evaluate which files are still useful (and document them / add targets to CMake), see
    check-markup (and dependencies bad.po.test, bad.po.test.exp)
    check_for_tutorial_problems.sh
    language_statistics.sh (and dependency LINGUAS)
    update_po_files.sh
