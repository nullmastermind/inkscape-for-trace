This directory contains code for handling on-canvas editing objects as
well as document display.

Historically, the code originates from GnomeCanvas but at this point it
has been completely rewritten for Inkscape's needs.

One can think of a CanvasItem as a light-weight widget. There is a
selection mechanism based on an item's position and a method to handle
events. The selection mechanism is currently very simplistic,
selecting the top-most item whose bounding box contains the
cursor. Probably as a result, many items do not use these capabilities
with external code replacing this functionality (e.g CanvasItemQuad,
CanvasItemCurve).

Points are stored as document coordinates. They are converted to
screen coordinates by multiplying by the document to window affine.
When an object's geometry changes, it must call request_update() to
flag that its bounds need to be recalculated (_need_update =
true). This will also cause all ancestors to also be marked and
finally the Canvas. Before picking or drawing, all bounds must be
up-to-date. (Changing the Canvas affine will also require bounds to be
recalculated.) This mechanism ensures that bounds are correct in the
most efficient manner. If only the style is changed (without geometric
ramifications) then call canvas->redraw_area() to trigger a redraw.

CanvasItemGroup keeps a list of child items using a Boost intrusive
list. The pointers between nodes are kept inside the items. This
allows for quick deletion by avoiding the need to search through the
list to find the item to delete. This is important when a path
contains hundress of nodes. However, a Boost intrusive list cannot be
used with C++ smart pointers. Deleting an item can be done by either
calling CanvasItemGroup::remove(CanvasItem*) or by directly deleting
the item. Deleting a CanvasItemGroup will delete it and all of its
children.

* CanvasItemBPath:     x  An item representing a Bezier path.
* CanvasItemCatchall:  x  An infinite item, for capturing left-over events.
* CanvasItemCtrl:      x  An item representing a control point (knot, node, etc.).
* CanvasItemCurve:        A single Bezier curve item (line or cubic). Not pickable!
* CanvasItemDrawing:   x  The SVG drawing.
* CanvasItemGrid:         Base class for snapping grids.
* CanvasItemGroup:     x  An item that contains other items.
* CanvasItemGuideline: x  A guideline for snapping.
* CanvasItemQuad:         An object defined by four points (only used by Text tool).
* CanvasItemRect:         An axis aligned rectangle item.
* CanvasItemRotate:    x  For previewing the rotation of the canvas.
* CanvasItemText:         A text item.

* CanvasItemEnum:         All the enums you'll want to use!
* CanvasItemBuffer:       A class that wraps a Cairo buffer for drawing.

Classes here that use CanvasItem's:

* CanvasGridXY:           A Cartesian grid for snapping.
* CanvasGridAxonom        An Axonometric grid for snapping.
* SnapIndicator:          A class for showing a snap possibility on canvas.
* TemporaryItem:          A class to manage the lifetime of a temporary CanvasItem.
* TemporaryItemList:      A class to track TemporaryItem's.


Notes:

CanvasItemCtrl (a.k.a. "Node", "Knot", "Handle", "Dragger", "Ctrl", "Mouse Grab", "Control Point")

  Used by several groups of classes:

  * Knot
  ** KnotHolderEntity
  *** live_effects/...
  *** KnotHolder: Contains one or more KnotHolderEntity's.
      Example: an object's fill and stroke gradients could have
      overlapping knot-entities and are moved together via the knot holder.
  **** shape-editor-knotholders.cpp
       Classes derived from KnotHolder which contain classes derived from KnotHolderEntity for
       editting shapes.
  **** ShapeEditor contains two KnotHolders, one for shapes, one for LPE's.

  ** ui/tools/tool-base.h
  ** seltrans.h,.cpp
  ** display/snap-indicator.h
  ** gradient-drag.cpp
  ** vanishing-point.h


  * ControlPoint, SelectorPoint, SelectableControlPoint, Handle, Node, CurveDragPoint, TransformHandle, plus
    auxillary classes (manipulator...).
  * drag-anchor
  * pen-tool
  * measure-tool
  * guide-line
  * snap-indicator


TODO:

Move files that use CanvasItem's to more appropriate places.

All files that use CanvasItem's in src directory:
* Move rubberband.h/.cpp to src/ui
* Move gradient-drag to src/ui
* Move selcue* to src/ui
* Move seltrans* to src/ui
* Move vanishing-point to src/ui
* Move snap code to src/ui/snap display/snap-indicator.h/.cpp snap.h etc.
